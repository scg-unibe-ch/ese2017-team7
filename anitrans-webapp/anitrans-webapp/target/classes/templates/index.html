<p id='text3'>When we reduce a shipment's overall footprint, or place it on the optimal combination of modes, we limit its impact on the environment. From a transportation standpoint, we use of one of the most fuel-efficient options.

Many shippers are surprised to learn that a one-ton load can travel an average of 650km by rail on a single gallon of diesel fuel. We’ve helped hundreds of customers lower their carbon footprint through intermodal by analyzing their freight patterns.

In addition, our transportation businesses is recognized as smart transport. We support logistical efficiency, driver training, automatic tire inflation systems, idling reduction and improved aerodynamics.</p>

<p id='text4'>We believe in Animal rights. It is the idea in which some, or all, non-human animals are entitled to the possession of their own lives and that their most basic interests—such as the need to avoid suffering—should be afforded the same consideration as similar interests of human beings.</p>
